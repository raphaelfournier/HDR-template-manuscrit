    over the Internet. Knowledge of pedophile activity in such networks remains
    limited, despite having important social consequences. Moreover, though
    there are different P2P systems in use, previous academic works on this
    topic focused on one system at a time and their results are not directly
    comparable. We design a methodology for comparing KAD and eDonkey, two P2P
    systems among the most prominent ones and with different anonymity levels.
    We monitor two eDonkey servers and the KAD network during several days and
    record hundreds of thousands of keyword-based queries. We detect
    pedophile-related queries with a previously validated tool and we propose,
    for the first time, a large-scale comparison of pedophile activity in two
    different P2P systems. We conclude that there are significantly fewer
    pedophile queries in KAD than in eDonkey (approximately 0.09\% vs. 0.25\%).},

  abstract  = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are a popular method to exchange
    large volume of data through the Internet. Pedophile activity is a very
    important topic for our societies and some works have recently attempted
    to gauge the extent of pedophile exchanges on P2P networks. A key issue is
    to obtain an efficient detection tool, which may decide if a sequence of
    keywords is related to the topic or not. 

    We propose to use the analysis of the social network bipartite graph in a
    large dataset from a P2P network to improve a state-of-the-art filter for
    pedophile queries. We obtain queries and thus combinations of words which
    were not tagged by the filter but should be. We also perform some
    experiments to see if the original four categories of paedophile queries
    were observable by topological measures only.},

    through peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which allow users to exchange files
    without a central server. Obtaining knowledge on the extent of this
    activity has major consequences for child protection, policy making and
    Internet regulation. Previous works have developed tools and analyses to
    provide overall figures in temporally-limited measurements. Offenders'
    behavior is mostly studied through small-scale interviews and there is few
    information on the times at which they engage in such activity. Here we
    show that the proportion of search-engine queries for pedophile content
    gradually has grown by a factor of almost 3 in three years. We also find
    that during the day, certain hours are, on average, privileged by seekers.
    Our results demonstrate that P2P networks are actively used to search for
    pedophile content and we find new and large-scale results on pedophile
    offenders' profile, indicating that a substantial proportion is
    well-integrated into family life and professional work activities.},

We propose an approach that leverages a music content model hidden in score notation, and define a set of composable operations to derive new "scores" from a corpus of existing ones. We show that this approach supplies a high-level tool to express common, useful applications, can easily be implemented on top of standard components, and finally gives rise to interesting conceptual issues related to the modeling of music notation.},

We focus here on the detection of (structurally and temporally) dense sequences of interactions that may indicate botnets or coordinated network scans. More precisely, we model a MAWI capture of IP traffic as a link streams, i.e., a sequence of interactions (t1,t2,u,v) meaning that devices u and v exchanged packets from time t1 to time t2. This traffic is captured on a single router and so has a bipartite structure: Links occur only between nodes in two disjoint sets. We design a method for finding interesting bipartite cliques in such link streams, i.e., two sets of nodes and a time interval such that all nodes in the first set are linked to all nodes in the second set throughout the time interval. We then explore the bipartite cliques present in the considered trace. Comparison with the MAWILab classification of anomalous IP addresses shows that the found cliques succeed in detecting anomalous network activity. },

  abstract = {Music is a temporal organization of sounds, and we can therefore assume that any music representation has a structure that reflects some conceptual principles. This structure is hardly explicitly accessible in many encodings, such as, for instance, audio files. However, it appears much more clearly in the language of music notation.

We propose to use the music notation language as a framework to model and manipulate the content of digital music objects, whatever their specific encoding may be. We describe an algebra that relies on this structured music representation to extract, restructure, and search such objects. The data model leverages the hidden structure of digital music encodings to enable powerful manipulations of their content.

We apply the model to collections of music scores. We describe a system, based
on an extension of XQuery with our algebra, that provides search,
reorganization, and extraction functionalities on top of large collections of
XML-encoded digital scores. Beyond its application to music objects, our work
shows how one can rely on a structured content embedded in a complex XML
encoding to develop robust collection management tools with minimal
implementation effort.},

  abstract = "While graph-based collaborative filtering recommender systems have been introduced several years ago, there are still several shortcomings to deal with, the temporal information being one of the most important. The new link stream paradigm is aiming at extending graphs for correctly modelling the graph dynamics, without losing crucial information. We investigate the impact of such link stream features for recommender systems. We design link stream features, that capture the intrinsic structure and dynamics of the data. We show that such features encode a fine-grained and subtle description of the underlying system. We focused on a traditional recommender system context, the rating prediction on the MovieLens20M movie dataset and the Goodreads book dataset. We input link stream features along with some content-based ones into a gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) and show that itoutperforms significantly a sole content-based solution. These encouraging results call for further exploration of this original modelling and its integration to complete state-of-the-art recommender systems algorithms. Link streams and graphs, as natural visualizations of recommender systems, may offer more interpretability in a time when algorithm transparency is an increasingly important topic of discussion. We also hope that these results will sparkle interesting discussions in the community about the connections between link streams and traditional methods (matrix factorization, deep learning).",

We design simple features modelling the structure and its evolution with time of recommender systems in order to validate this claim. We learn these features alongside classical content-based features, using a gradient boosting machine model (XgBoost) and perform rating prediction on a movie rating dataset, MovieLens20M, and a book rating dataset, from GoodReads. We obtain comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, and some interesting leads in terms of explicability. },

Following the Unix diff model for text files, we propose an original procedure for computing the differences between two XML score files. It performs a comparison of scores at the notation (graphical) level, based on a new intermediate tree representation of the mu- sic notation content of a score and a combination of sequence- and tree-edit distances. We also propose a tool to visualize the differ- ences between two scores side-by-side, using the music notation engraving library Verovio, and we employ it to test the procedure on an OMR dataset. },

We evaluate the effect of different parts of a HIN on the accuracy and the diversity of recommendations, then investigate if these effects are only due to the semantic content encoded in the network. We use recently-proposed diversity measures which are based on the network structure and better suited to the HIN formalism. Finally, we randomly shuffle the edges of some parts of the HIN, to empty the network from its semantic content, while leaving its structure relatively unaffected. We show that the semantic content encoded in the network data has a limited importance for the performance of a recommender system and that structure is crucial. },

Both elements are fundamental for the production of a full-fledged musical score and facilitate many MIR tasks such as harmonic analysis, section identification, melodic similarity, and search in a digital music library. We design a deep recurrent neural network model that only requires information readily available in all kinds of MIDI files, including performances, or other symbolic en- codings. We release a model trained on the ASAP dataset. Our system can be used with these pre-trained parameters and is easy to integrate into a MIR pipeline. We also pro- pose a data augmentation procedure that helps re-training on small datasets. PKSpell achieves strong key signature estimation per- formance on a challenging dataset. Most importantly, this model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the MuseData pitch spelling dataset without retraining. },

	abstract = {Web Image Context Extraction (WICE) consists in obtaining the textual information describing an image using the content of the surrounding webpage. A common preprocessing step before performing WICE is to render the content of the webpage. When done at a large scale (e.g., for search engine indexation), it may become very computationally costly (up to several seconds per page). To avoid this cost, we introduce a novel WICE approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Natural Language Processing models. Our method relies on a graph model containing both node types and text as features. The model is fed through several blocks of GNNs to extract the textual context. Since no labeled WICE dataset with ground truth exists, we train and evaluate the GNNs on a proxy task that consists in finding the semantically closest text to the image caption. We then interpret importance weights to find the most relevant text nodes and define them as the image context. Thanks to GNNs, our model is able to encode both structural and semantic information from the webpage. We show that our approach gives promising results to help address the large-scale WICE problem using only HTML data.},

	abstract = {Diversity is a concept relevant to numerous domains of research varying from ecology, to information theory, and to economics, to cite a few. It is a notion that is steadily gaining attention in the information retrieval, network analysis, and artificial neural networks communities. While the use of diversity measures in network-structured data counts a growing number of applications, no clear and comprehensive description is available for the different ways in which diversities can be measured. In this article, we develop a formal framework for the application of a large family of diversity measures to heterogeneous information networks (HINs), a flexible, widely-used network data formalism. This extends the application of diversity measures, from systems of classifications and apportionments, to more complex relations that can be better modeled by networks. In doing so, we not only provide an effective organization of multiple practices from different domains, but also unearth new observables in systems modeled by heterogeneous information networks. We illustrate the pertinence of our approach by developing different applications related to various domains concerned by both diversity and networks. In particular, we illustrate the usefulness of these new proposed observables in the domains of recommender systems and social media studies, among other fields.},

  ABSTRACT = {We address the problem of scalable content-based search in large
              collections of music documents. Music content is highly complex
              and versatile and presents multiple facets that can be considered
              independently or in combination. Moreover, music documents can be
              digitally encoded in many ways. We propose a general framework for
              building a scalable search engine, based on (i) a music
              description language that represents music content independently
              from a specific encoding, (ii) an extendible list of
              feature-extraction functions, and (iii) indexing, searching, and
              ranking procedures designed to be integrated into the standard
              architecture of a text-oriented search engine. As a proof of
              concept, we also detail an actual implementation of the framework
              for searching in large collections of XML-encoded music scores,
              based on the popular ElasticSearch system. It is released as
              open-source in GitHub, and available as a ready-to-use Docker
              image for communities that manage large collections of digitized
              music documents.},

We examine total and partial temporal (in)consistency relations between sets of temporal formulae. Then we propose a new Temporal Parametric Semantics, which may combine several sub-functions, allowing to use different assessment strategies.
